## Drawing Session Tips
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours per session, 2-3 sessions per drawing.
- **Binaural Beats**: Listen to alpha (8-12 Hz) or beta (14-30 Hz) tracks via headphones.
- **Steps**:
  1. Sketch lightly with white pencil.
  2. Block in sea, sky, and sails with main colors.
  3. Add details (waves, stars, rigging) with vibrant pencils.
  4. Check contrast—ensure colors pop on black paper.
- **Materials**: 9x12-inch black paper, colored pencils for black paper, good lighting.

## Progress Tracking
- Log each completed drawing in a notebook or app.
- Note what worked well (e.g., color choices, techniques).
- Photograph each piece for the portfolio.

## Portfolio Assembly
- Store drawings in a binder with protective sleeves or a digital folder.
- Share on X or with friends to celebrate completion.

## Motivation
Each drawing brings you closer to a stunning portfolio. Use binaural beats to stay focused, and visualize your finished collection to reinforce your goal-oriented mindset.
